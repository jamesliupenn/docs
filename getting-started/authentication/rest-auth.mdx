# REST API Authentication
<Warning>
    Developers need to be registered with DIMO by providing your preferred `client_id` and `redirect_uri`. Please reach out to us on Discord for this.
</Warning>

1. Registered `client_id` and `redirect_uri`
2. An Ethereum address for your wallet (a 64 character hex string generated subject to various rules defined in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf))
3. The `private_key` of your wallet. To obtain the `private_key` of your wallet, please follow the Developer FAQ.

<Info>
    The `private_key` allows you to validate your sign in to your wallet `0xA`, so you'll get to see what `0xA` has access to on the blockchain.
